# Puttytribe-Dark
This is a dark mode CSS file for Puttytribe, intended to be installed with the "Stylish" Safari extension, or in the browser of your choice with a similar custom-css extension/plugin.

This repository will always contain the latest Dark Mode css, and I'll post to the forum thread when there's an update (so leave your notifications for the forum thread below turned on).

## Installation instructions:
You need to be a member of the Puttytribe to benefit from this anyway, so the instructions are [over here on the forum.](http://theputtytribe.com/forum/topics/dark-mode-for-puttytribe-com-safari)

## Here it is in action:

Enjoy! :)
